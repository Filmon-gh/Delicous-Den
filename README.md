 - Command Line Interface: The command line interface  used to connect GitHub and Visual Studio Code. This allowed for seamless collaboration between the two technologies, enabling to push changes to GitHub from the local machine and to pull changes from GitHub to the local machine. 

## Testing 

During the development process, the web pages is thoroughly tested to ensure its reliability and usability.   

 - The navigation links were tested to ensure that users could easily navigate through the website and find the relevant pages. It is also made sure that it is clearly visible to users on different devices. 

 - The social media icons were also tested to ensure that users could easily navigate through the website and access the social media pages. 

 - The Contact Us form tested to ensure that all fields were working correctly, and the form's data was also checked to ensure that it was properly checking for required fields and validating input data, such as email addresses and phone numbers. 

 - In addition, the Submit button also checked to ensure that the confirmation page is working correctly. This was done to ensure that users would receive a clear confirmation message after submitting the form, providing them with the necessary feedback.

The responsiveness of the web pages is also thoroughly tested to ensure that they can be easily accessed and navigated on different devices. The testing process involved checking the layout and design of the website across a range of devices, including laptops, tablets, and smartphones, to ensure that users could access and interact with the website seamlessly. 

During the testing process, I identified and resolved any issues related to the responsiveness of the web pages layout and design.

## Bugs

When implementing the customer review section on the home page, I initially set the width and height of the profile pictures to be equal. However, this losses the quality of the images, which was reflected in a lower best practice report from Lighthouse.

To resolve this issue, I changed the aspect ratio of the width and height of the images based on the ratio of their original pixel size. This adjustment helped to maintain the quality of the images and resulted in clear profile pictures being displayed on the page.

## Validator Testing
 - HTML --fter running the code through the official W3C validator, no errors were found.
 - CSS --After running the code through the official (Jigsaw) alidator, no errors were found.
 - Accesibility -By running the project through Lighthouse, I have confirmed that the chosen colors and font size are easy to read and accessible.
